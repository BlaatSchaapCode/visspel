# visspel

The visspel, (dutch for fishing game) is an open source game we are developing.
It is currently not playable.

For the deveolper documentation, see the wiki.

# What is an issue?

Open source game development is hard as we need to keep focussed what the game is about. Therefore, we don't want people to request features what they think should be in game.

For features, only the core development team may add them. This is used for anything the code development team decides is needed. If you believe a feature is needed, talk to us on the `#vissenspel` IRC channel on blaatschaap.

For bugs, it is acceptable to report them. You don't need to ask us permission for that. Examples of bugs are:
* Display issues.
* Anything that causes weird things to happen.
* Anything that will cause your game to crash.
* Anything that causes undefined behaviour, according to the c++ standard. This at least includes anything found with ASAN, UBSAN or valgrind.
